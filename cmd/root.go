const lngMsg = (`Jotl is a versatile CLI tool designed to streamline log management for developers by logging console outputs into an SQLite database. 

Jotl comes packed with powerful features:
- A **studio**, which provides an interactive web-based UI for log management.
- A **real-time terminal dashboard (TUI)** for tracking errors and logs directly within your terminal.

Jotl enables developers to initialize projects, log application output in a structured database, and review logs via either the command line or a web UI. Whether you're debugging locally or managing multiple environments, Jotl offers a flexible and reliable solution.
